    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Kids Home, Montesori based Pre- school is established in 2015 with a goal to guide kids to explore, help them to acquire skills and instill in them the joy of learning, which would set the tone for the rest of their lives. At Kids Home, we work towards exploring the innate potential of each child, believing each one to be unique. We provide day care service to children aged from 6 months for working parents in flexible hours. Our pre-school program usually starts with a child at two and a half or three years of age to 6 years.</p>

    <h5>Hygiene and Safety</h5>
<p>Primarily, for us, hygiene and the safety of children matters a lot. This has translated into us taking complete care in maintaining hygiene in our Pre-School & DayCare and being pro safety. We’ve introduced and implemented safety & hygiene measures at our Pre-Schools. </p>

<h5>Unique Delivery Method</h5>
<p>Based on our curriculum, we’ve devised our teaching methodology to suit the age group. We prioritize, initially to draw the child’s attention and then keeping his/her mind engaged and making the learning process interesting and absorbing.</p>

<h5>Friendly Ambience</h5>
<p>We are located in peaceful and up-market locations, our Pre-Schools & DayCare provide an environment wherein children are safe, nurtured, loved and encouraged to learn. The colourful and child-friendly ambience adds to children’s excitement and ensures that they are safe.</p>
 
<h5>Meals on Demand</h5>
<p>We take care of your child’s nutrition by offering them a safe and nutritious diet plan at our Pre-School & DayCare. We offer exclusive daycare facility to working parents, to help you focus better on work. At Kids Home, we plan, build and run a best-in-class child care facility through various daycare models which makes parenting fun & comfortable for you.</p>

 <h5> Scholarship</h5>
 <p> We, at Kids Home provides <b>scholarship</b> for orphan, poor and marginalized kids so that they won't be deprived of getting well education from early days. If we come to know the real condition of kids, we provide  discount on monthly fees, admission, food and stationary. Additionally, we also look for personal donars who can support for their monthly fees. The main purpose of this project is to focus on <b>child rights and equal opportunies for all children</b>, despite their caste, race, class and group.</p> 

 <h5>Our Achievements</h5>
 <p>As, we coordinate and network with other renowned schools in Kathmandu valley and also request for emrollement of our kids to those schools in personal relation. Furthermore, we also make reference from our side. In this process, our one student is enrolled in Ullens School Khumaltar in 2018. Similarly, our two students are succeeded to enroll in St.Xavier school Jawalakhel this year 2020.
